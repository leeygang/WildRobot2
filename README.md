# WildRobot2

WildRobot2 is a clean, ToddlerBot-aligned software stack for the second
WildRobot hardware generation.

The repository contains the canonical WR2 MuJoCo model, a versioned
action/observation contract, and the first flat-ground Brax/MJX walking
environment. A bench-only HTD-45H qualification driver is included; full
robot hardware drivers and policy deployment remain future phases.

## Repository layout

- `wr2/descriptions`: MJCF assets and robot configuration.
- `wr2/sim`: common simulation/hardware interface.
- `wr2/actuation`: physical actuator drivers.
- `wr2/sensing`: physical sensor adapters and frame conversion.
- `wr2/reference`: nominal and recorded motion references.
- `wr2/locomotion`: MJX environment and PPO training entry point.
- `wr2/policies`: deployable policies and the policy runner.
- `wr2/tools`: model post-processing, calibration, and sim-to-real utilities.
- `motion`: version-controlled motion data.
- `tests`: model, transmission, and interface regression tests.
- `results`: generated runs and checkpoints; ignored by Git.

See [`docs/design/architecture.md`](docs/design/architecture.md) for ownership
rules and the implementation sequence.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --extra training --extra dev
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv run python -m wr2.tools.post_process
uv run python -m wr2.locomotion.train --smoke
```

See [`docs/design/training_interface.md`](docs/design/training_interface.md)
for the 60-value actor observation, 17-value action contract, and remaining
hardware gates. See [`docs/design/servo_model.md`](docs/design/servo_model.md)
for the evidence and limitations behind the initial HTD-45H model.
The staged high-load qualification procedure is in
[`docs/hardware/htd45h_deployment_test.md`](docs/hardware/htd45h_deployment_test.md).
